       "['from the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film they create the tone for what will follow steven spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn t have a dull moment mr spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of leonardo dicaprio it s very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer he was a fast talker and a slick operator he exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies it s a welcome sight to have mr dicaprio working in a vehicle that shows his talent as frank abagnale a man of many faces he plays a game of hide and seek throughout the movie with hanratty the fbi agent that is in his trail tom hanks shows great assurance and gusto with this character of course the dicaprio magnetism dominates the action with the many ironic twists and the miraculous and narrow escapes he pulls with an aplomb that s bewildering to the feds who are on his tail all the time the minor roles are equally important christopher walken as the father starts out as the prototype of the con man but he s too decent to do wrong his business fails eventually his marriage to natalie baye the fine french actress ends in divorce because obviously she hates being married to a loser the action doesn t stop for one moment this film is great fun to watch with the winning combination mr spielberg assured hand gives us this time out mr spielberg can thank the genial mr dicaprio who responds obviously to his direction and makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes',\n",
       " 'while watching catch me if you can i had so much fun i smiled constantly well that smile was interrupted by laughs the movie tells the story of frank w abignale jr who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher after his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co pilot a doctor a lawyer the way he does this is funny and brilliant i am not a big fan of leonardo dicaprio who plays frank but in this movie he is perfect he gives a very fine performance tom hanks is the fbi agent carl who is after him and as always hanks is good the story is inspired by a real story i don t know in how many ways it is true but watching this guy all i wanted to see was him pulling more of his nice little tricks the scene where he pretends to be a schoolteacher is just great if you want a nice funny movie not too heavy this one will definitely please you',\n",
       " 'what a terrific piece of film making from the charming animated title sequence featuring john williams s delightfully sneaky score to the end this is an enormously entertaining film from the gifted craftsman steven spielberg who is so damn good people take him for granted or resent his manipulation i e his seemingly effortless ability to create effective drama leonardo dicaprio in his best performance that i ve seen stars as frank abagnale jr a real life teen aged con man so spectacularly gifted that he was able to steal millions from various companies with forged checks while successfully impersonating an airline pilot a doctor and a lawyer among other guises he is chased by a rigidly rule bound f b i agent carl hanratty tom hanks who is at first comically out classed by the young improvising criminal genius but the agent is steadfast and relentless and has the law on his side the movie is filled with delightful supporting performances starting with hanks and continuing on with nathalie baye as the boy s selfish mother amy adams as his immature fianc e and on down to the tiniest role i m especially grateful for the sympathetic part given to christopher walken as the mischievous and spirited abagnale sr whose life darkens as his fortunes fall walken is one of my favorite actors but while i enjoy the occasional one dimensional freak or villain he plays i wish most of his parts were like this spielberg s movie is rich with fascinating details and memorable incidents while the script by jeff nathanson moves backward and forward in time to tell the story in the most engrossing way possible this is top notch entertainment',\n",
       " 'at first i thought i was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead i watched another impressive achievement by steven spielberg a few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific leonardo dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he s someone else dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies tom hanks as the fbi agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in a league of their own and his mere presence adds more to this film the sign of a great film star and christopher walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career the last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of walken you can understand why dicaprio admires and loves his father walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately i ll be rooting for him at oscar time another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by janusz kaminski who s a real artist with a camera and has worked on several spielberg films one shot in particular stands out the ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on walken very thought provoking and of course since its a spielberg film its very personal spielberg was interested in the frank abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there also the real frank abagnale jr appears as a french police officer well made extremely well acted and sharply written viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath this really is a personal film from spielberg and a very good one',\n",
       " 'i don t know how accurate these events are but as they are based on accounts written by frank abagale jr himself then i assume that they are probably only dramatised for the viewing audience it s hard to believe that people were so naive that they allowed frank abagnale to achieve what he did but i have give the guy credit for pushing the system and riding the high life for as long as he did leonardo dicaprio does a great job of capturing the character of frank abignale jr strange i didn t picture him in the role of a jet setting gigalo and the rest of the cast although only little more than fringe characters are all very well cast and give typically fine performances as you would expect with the calibre of hanks and walken all in all this is a fine film that most people will enjoy watching 0',\n",

famous around the world catch me if you can is a very different spielberg film it s a off beat comedy with a bit of suspense mixed into it critics and fans have been criticize spielberg for the last twenty years for his attempt for doing a comedy film which was now spielberg has managed to succeed in making a enjoyable comedy film where had tons of slapstick comedy and buildings falling apart in the name of laughs catch me is more from personality and wit catch me if you can is based on the true story of frank abagnale jr leonardo dicaprio frank is known to be the most successful con artist and check forger in u s history abagnale posed as a pan am air pilot doctor and proscutor when he didn t even complete high school abagnale also went around the world making and cashing about million dollars with bogus checks despite that the checks would bounce like a rubber ball frank had enough intelligence to fool the banks and even the the companines he claimed he worked for it took federal agent carl hanratty tom hanks to identify frank s mistakes which led carl on a cross country pursuit for frank while carl is staying around the clock trying to figure out more about frank and his whereabouts frank keeps changing his name occupation and girlfriend the only two people that remain close to frank s life is carl hanratty and frank s father frank abagnale sr christopher walken the film shows that one of the reasons why frank remains to do his numerous crimes is to purchse expenisve things for his divorced father who is depressed from having his wife leave him on her request and the closing of his family owned stationary store where frank learned about his numerous tricks of forgery when i heard about catch me being the new spielberg film i bought a copy of the book written in first person by the real frank abagnale i highly enjoyed the book with the way abagnale explains on what he did how he did it and the numerous funny parts that would be great to be put on film after watching the movie i was slightly disappointed in the film there were some parts in abagnale s book that i was looking so much forward to be seeing in the movie including a part in the book where abagnale gets involved with bailbonds man sadly to my disappointment it wasn t featured in the film i then read a interview on why spielberg was so attached to direct catch me if you can and when you watch the movie it s obviously shown on the screen spielberg loved the father son relationship between frank sr and jr in fact the relationship was partially mention in the book in the film it s carried thoughout the film while the movie does touches on the various career changes and check forgery also since the book was written in first person the character of carl hanratty was mention here in there where hanratty is the second most seen character in the film right behind frank but other than that catch me if you can is a very enjoyable and entertaining film i ve always been devoted to mr spielberg and this is a very different film for him it is historical takes place in the past but it s the first time where most of the film is being told from one character s narrative spielberg does a great job with telling the story he even adds a nice touch of the mid 0 s film style and mood with the opening credits being animated very similar to the opening credits of dozens of 0 s comedies then john williams also adds the final touch with the jazzy score that is heavy on the clarinet and brass than the usual strings most people groan and moan when they hear the name leonardo dicaprio oh no not that guy i do agree dicaprio does get overexposure but he is a good actor look at what s eating gilbert grape and this boys life he did a excellent job in both films i think most people just think of dicaprio in titanic which wasn t his fault as much as it was james cameron s dicaprio might win over some people with his performance in this film which shows that dicaprio did understand the personality and that frank had a fun time while doing all of the check swindeling christoper walken breaks out of his stereotyped acting that many comedians and t v shows have made fun of in the past and delivers a very good performance just watch the scene when he talks to frank jr about his still love and devotion to the woman that left him for another man but tom hanks is the pro and he proves it again in this film hanks portrayal of hanratty with the boston accent and the combination of the clumsy actions yet intelligent mind makes the hanratty character the most enjoyable federal agent since tommy lee jones sam gerrad in the fugitive hanks did a brilliant job with michael sullivan in road to perdition and he does it again with carl hanratty in catch me if you can i can not judge if catch me if you can should get any oscar nominations i haven t seen gangs of new york adaptation and chicago yet but from what i ve seen catch me is great but it s not better than two towers minority report solaris road to perdition bowling for columbine and punch drunk love if there should be any nominations then hanks should get nominated for best supporting actor for playing hanratty catch me if you can is a very enjoyable film it s a big risk of a film for spielberg to return to comedy but this film proves that spielberg can now do any genre including comedy and pull it
